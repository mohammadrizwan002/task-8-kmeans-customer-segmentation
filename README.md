Task 8: K-Means Clustering - Customer Segmentation

This project applies K-Means Clustering to the Mall_Customers dataset to identify customer segments based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

What I Did:
- Loaded and cleaned dataset
- Used Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
- Applied K-Means Clustering
- Visualized clustered groups
- Evaluated performance using Silhouette Score

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Result:
Optimal number of clusters = 5  
Silhouette Score = 0.555
